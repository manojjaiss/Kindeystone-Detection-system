# Kindeystone Detection System

This is a Computer Graphics and Image Processing (CGIP) Mini Project developed for university examination purposes at Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU). The project focuses on detecting specific patterns or features within images using various image processing techniques.

## Project Overview

The Kindeystone Detection System is designed to identify and highlight certain key features in an image. This system leverages the power of image processing algorithms to detect patterns that are otherwise difficult to discern with the naked eye. The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of theoretical concepts learned in the CGIP course into a practical and functional system.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Enhances the image quality to make it suitable for further processing.
- **Feature Extraction:** Identifies and extracts key features from the image.
- **Pattern Detection:** Detects specific patterns or shapes in the processed image.
- **Visualization:** Highlights the detected patterns on the image for easy visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm / VSCode

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manojjaiss/kindeystone-detection-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd kindeystone-detection-system
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the image you want to process.
2. Run the preprocessing steps to enhance the image.
3. Apply the feature extraction algorithm to identify key features.
4. Detect specific patterns within the image.
5. Visualize the results.
